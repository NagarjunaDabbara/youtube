Instructions:
------------
npm i  - Install npm modules

npm run test - Runs all the tests in headless mode and generates Mochawesome reports at the end of test execution
npm run open - Headful mode

Concepts used:
-------------
Page object model - framework model

Fixtures - to maintain the test data and expected data

Mochawesome reports - Test reports created at reports/mochareports/report.html

Screenshots - Cypress creates a folder on test failures

Videos  - Cypress creates videos folder and saves screen casts of test execution when run on headless mode

Assertions - I used both Cypress built in assertions and Chai assertions in pages
